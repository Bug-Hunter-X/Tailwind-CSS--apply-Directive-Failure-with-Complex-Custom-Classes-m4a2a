This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with custom utility classes that contain variables or complex selectors.  The `@apply` directive attempts to resolve these complex values at compile time, but it might fail due to the way the custom classes are defined or how they interact with other parts of your Tailwind CSS configuration. For example, a custom class that relies on a variable that isn't defined or a selector that's incorrectly formatted can cause this error. This leads to unexpected styles being applied, or no styles being applied at all, leading to visual discrepancies or rendering issues.
